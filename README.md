Hey Guys, :-)
The idea behind this project struck me when I was planning to buy 
Amazon fire TV stick and didn't have enough budget to fully coverup those expenses on my own. So I came up
with this idea to program this bot which emails me whenever the price goes
down than your expected value or equals to.

It can be deployed on any cloud server(like rasberry pi, arduino, AWS, Goggle cloud etc.)
to make full use of, or it can also be used on your daily machine using TMUX(computer[WARNING: WILL
CONSUME A SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE]).
<h3>THIS PROGRAM CAN DIRECTLY RUN ON TERMINAL WINDOW WITH ALL APPROPRIATE LIBRARIES</h3>

<h2>Prerequisites--</h2>

<h3>Libraries-</h3>
1. bs4<br/>
2. time<br/>
3. requests<br/>

5. Go on the link https://www.mailjet.com/ , make an account; copy the api and secret key; paste in the program where commented.

<h3>Email Service-</h3>
Go on your email provider and enable access to less secure apps in settings of your mailing
service.[If you are using google for your mailing service, gmail's step by step guide is given below...]

For google, go to <br/>-> Manage account in Profile<br/> -> Security tab<br/> -> Scroll
