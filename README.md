Hey Guys, :-)
The idea behind this project struck me when I was planning to buy 
Amazon fire TV stick and didn't have enough budget to fully coverup those expenses on my own. So I came up
with this idea to program this bot which emails me whenever the price goes
down than your expected value or equals to.

It can be deployed on any cloud server(like rasberry pi, arduino, AWS, Goggle cloud etc.)
to make full use of, or it can also be used on your daily machine using TMUX(computer[WARNING: WILL
CONSUME A SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE IN YOUR DAILY LIFE]).
