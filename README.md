Hey Guys, :-)
The idea behind this project actually struck me when I was planning to buy 
Amazon fire TV stick and didn't have the appropriate budget. So I came up
with this idea to program this bot which emails me whenever the price goes
down than your expected value or equals to.

It can be deployed on any server(like rasberry pi, arduino etc.) to make
full use of, or it can also be used on your daily machine(computer[WILL
TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE IN DAILY LIFE]).

<h2>Prerequisites--</h2>

Just go on google and check your browser version. -> Copying the version,
download your version of web driver from google and paste it in the same
