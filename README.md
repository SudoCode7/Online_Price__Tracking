Hey Guys, :-)
The idea behind this project actually struck me when I was planning to buy 
Amazon fire TV stick and didn't have the appropriate budget. So I came up
with this idea to program this bot which emails me whenever the price goes
down than your expected value or equals to.

It can be deployed on any server(like rasberry pi, arduino etc.) to make
full use of, or it can also be used on your daily machine(computer[WILL
TAKE A SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCE IN DAILY LIFE]).
<h3>THIS PROGRAM CAN DIRECTLY RUN ON TERMINAL WINDOW WITH ALL APPROPRIATE LIBRARIES</h3>

<h2>Prerequisites--</h2>

<h3>Libraries-</h3>
1. bs4
2. time
3. requests

<h3>Email Service-</h3>
Just go and enable access to less secure apps in settings of your mailing
service.[google for your particular mailing service, gmail is given below]

For google, go to Manage your account in Profile -> Security tab -> Scroll

<h3>WARNING: I AM NOT RESPONIBLE FOR ANY OF YOUR STUPID STUFF</h3>
